            <h2>What is Web Development?</h2>
            <p>
                Web development refers to the building, creating, and maintaining of websites. It includes aspects such
                as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. It is the creation of an
                application that works over the internet i.e. websites.<br><br>Web developers create and maintain
                websites. They are also responsible for the site's technical aspects, such as its performance and
                capacity, which are measures of a website's speed and how much traffic the site can handle. In addition,
                web developers may create content for the site.<br><br>There are three types of web development roles:
                developers who specialize in the user interface (“front-end”), those who write the underlying code for
                running all website operations (“back-end”), and those who manage all aspects of a website (“full
                stack”).<br><br>
                “As a web developer, you will encounter numerous challenges. Some of them will be easy to fix, while
                others will be extremely hard,” Kowalski says. “It's critical to be persistent in improving your skills
                since the industry is ever-changing.” There's definitely a lot to learn in web development.
            </p>
            <p>
                You ideally would have an aptitude or experience of elements such as:
            <ul>
                <li>User experience</li>
                <li>User interface</li>
                <li>Visual design</li>
                <li>Coding languages such as HTML and CSS</li>
                <li>Front end programming languages</li>
                <li>Back end programming languages</li>
                <li>Design software like Photoshop, Illustrator, and Sketch</li>
                <li>Understanding of SEO</li>
                <li>Web servers and how they function</li>
            </ul>

        <!--Front end dev-->
        <section class="section-title front-end-dev" id="front-end">
            <h2>Starting Out with Front End Development</h2>
            <p>The front end of an application typically refers to the layer that represents the UI (user interface).
                This can include anything from a static site with HTML and CSS to a full React app that powers the UI. -
                Colby Fayock</p>
            <div class="text-center">
                <img src="/static/images/frontend.png">
            </div>
            <h4>Let's Start with HTML</h4>
            <p>
                HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For
                example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using
                images and data tables. Using HTML, you can define headers, paragraphs, links, images, and more, so your
                browser knows how to structure the web page you're looking at.</p>

            <h4>What about CSS?</h4>
            <p>CSS is an acronym for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for
                example, for changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to create a layout — for
                example, turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for
                related information. CSS is a rule-based language — you define the rules by specifying groups of styles
                that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page. It can even be
                used for effects such as animation. It consists of 3 types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Inline CSS</li>
                <li>Internal CSS</li>
                <li>External CSS</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>What is JavaScript used for?</h4>
            <p>JavaScript is a programming language used mainly on the client-side to help web pages be more
                interactive. JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content,
                control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. JavaScript is the most popular and
                most widely developed programming language ever existed. JavaScript is a must-have for Web developers,
                Front-end/ Back-end developers, Mobile / Desktop developers, Graphics / Game developers and even for
                Full Stack developers as well. Most of the functions and applications that make the Internet
                indispensable to modern life are coded in some form of JavaScript.

        <!--frameworks-->
        <section class="section-title frameworks" id="frameworks">
            <h2>Learning About Frameworks</h2>
            <p>
                A web development framework is a set of resources and tools for software developers to build and manage
                web applications, web services and websites. React, Vue, Ember, Bootstrap, and Angular are the most
                famous front-end frameworks. Django, Ruby On Rails, Spring, Express, ASP.NET Core are the most famous
                backend frameworks.
                The aim of frameworks is to provide a common structure so that developers don't have to redo it from
                scratch and can reuse the code provided. In this way, frameworks allow us to cut out much of the work
                and save a lot of time. To summarize: there's no need to reinvent the wheel.</p>
            <h4>Intro to React.js</h4>
            <p>
                The React. js framework is an open-source JavaScript framework and library developed by Facebook. It's
                used for building interactive user interfaces and web applications quickly and efficiently with
                significantly less code than you would with vanilla JavaScript. It is maintained by Facebook. Moreover,
                React Js makes Front-end development very easy. Both HTML and CSS are integral to any web development
                project. If you have these skills already, then learning React should be a relatively straightforward
                process. It has its own unique set of challenges, but it is an excellent tool to have in order to start
                or further your career as a web developer.
            </p>
            <h4>Stepping into React Native</h4>
            <p>
                React Native is great for mobile apps. It provides a slick, smooth and responsive user interface, while
                significantly reducing load time. It's also much faster and cheaper to build apps in React Native as
                opposed to building native ones, without the need to compromise on quality and functionality. React is
                known as ReactJs, which is a JavaScript library to build single-page web applications. Besides, React
                Native is a React JS-based framework to design mobile apps. Moreover, with reusable components, you can
                develop native mobile applications.</p>
            <h4>Moving forward to Next.js</h4>
            <p>
                Next.js is a React framework that gives you building blocks to create web applications. By framework, we
                mean Next.js handles the tooling and configuration needed for React, and provides additional structure,
                features, and optimizations for your application.
                Next is a framework for react which is built upon react library. React is a library, not a framework.
                Next is famous for Server-side rendering and static generation of websites. React on the other side
                doesn't support Server-side rendering. Next. js is a minimalistic framework that helps you create
                server-rendered React applications. In traditional web development, the frontend and backend parts of an
                application were two separate things.</p>
            <h4>Exploring Gatsby JS</h4>
            <p>
                Gatsby is a free, open-source, React-based framework designed to help developers build performant
                websites and apps. Put simply, Gatsby is a static site generator that leverages React. Gatsby allows the
                developers to make a site using React and work with any data source (CMSs, Markdown, etc) of their
                choice.
                It's equally great for web applications. You may not know this. Gatsby is great for building web
                experiences that leverage the benefits of both so called static sites and web applications —
                simultaneously.
            </p>
            <h4>Discovering Electron</h4>
            <p>
                Electron, also called Electron JS, is a software development framework for building native applications
                (applications that run natively on Windows, macOS, and Linux) using web technologies, such as
                JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
                Because all the platforms support web technologies, ElectronJS helps in developing Cross-Platform apps
                easier. Popular applications that use ElectronJS include Visual Studio Code, Slack, and Atom Editor.
                It is officially maintained by Github but has a very active community behind it. Today, some of the most
                popular desktop apps (many you probably use) are entirely written in Electron such as Atom, Visual
                Studio Code, Slack, Microsoft Teams, Github Desktop, Whatsapp Desktop, Figma Desktop, and much more.</p>
            <h4>Exceling to GraphQL</h4>
            <p>
                GraphQL is a query language and server-side runtime for application programming interfaces (APIs) that
                prioritizes giving clients exactly the data they request and no more. GraphQL is designed to make APIs
                fast, flexible, and developer-friendly.
                GraphQL is neither the frontend or backend but rather the language spoken between the two to exchange
                information.
                GraphQL responses are in JSON. Every response is a JSON map, and will include JSON keys for "data" ,
                "errors" , or "extensions" following the GraphQL specification.
                A well-designed API is very easy to use and learn. It's also intuitive, a good point to keep in mind
                when you're starting to design your API. To solve these problems, Facebook created GraphQL. Today, I
                think GraphQL is the best way to build APIs.</p>

        <!--package managers-->
        <section class="section-title package-managers" id="packages">
            <h2>What are Package Managers used for?</h2>
            <p>
                A package manager keeps track of what software is installed on your computer, and allows you to easily install new software, upgrade software to newer versions, or remove software that you previously installed.<br><br>Yarn installs dependency packages in parallel, whereas NPM installs them sequentially. As a result, Yarn outperforms NPM when installing bigger files. Both tools can save dependent files to the offline cache. The major difference between NPM and Yarn comes in terms of security performance. While NPM installs packages sequentially, Yarn performs parallel installation resulting in better speed and performance. NPM has tried to fix vulnerabilities, but still, Yarn is considered more secure than NPM.</p>

        <!--UXUI-->
        <section class="section-title uxui" id="uxui">
            <h2>What is UX/UI?</h2>
            <p>
                A basic understanding of user experience (UX) design will help understand which will not work for the
                user before product development. Mockups and prototypes will reduce user-related bugs' chances, and it
                will minimize the development cycle time. The developers can make a clear decision on software
                development with prototyping.<br><br>The user interface (UI) and UX Design help to win the consumers'
                confidence and make them use your application or website providing them what they are looking for. The
                number of consumers you are getting on your website/application can measure the success of the great UI
                and UX.</p>

        <!--Back end dev-->
        <section class="section-title back-end-dev" id="back-end">
            <h2>Venturing into Back End Development</h2>
            <p>Back-end development means working on server-side software, which focuses on everything you can't see on
                a website. Back-end developers ensure the website performs correctly, focusing on databases, back-end
                logic, application programming interface (APIs), architecture, and servers. A back-end web developer is
                responsible for server-side web application logic and integration of the work front-end developers do.
                Back-end developers are usually write the web services and APIs used by front-end developers and mobile
                application developers. There are three major parts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The server</li>
                <li>The app</li>
                <li>The database</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="text-center">

            </div>
            <h4>What does Node.js do?</h4>
            <p>As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network
                applications. In the following "hello world" example, many connections can be handled concurrently. Upon
                each connection, the callback is fired, but if there is no work to be done, Node.js will sleep. Node.js
                is similar in design to, and influenced by, systems like Ruby's Event Machine and Python's Twisted.
                Node.js takes the event model a bit further. It presents an event loop as a runtime construct instead of
                as a library.</p>
            <h4>What is JSON APIs?</h4>
            <p>People develop APIs for a variety of reasons, such as to create a tool to facilitate internal processes
                or an external product for customers or to build a third party tool. And for such purpose JSON comes to
                the rescue. The open standard format JSON follows shared conventions that help in increasing
                productivity, take advantage of generalized tooling, and focus on the web applications. <br><br>JSON or
                JavaScript Object Notation is an encoding scheme that is designed to eliminate the need for an ad-hoc
                code for each application to communicate with servers that communicate in a defined way. JSON API module
                exposes an implementation for data stores and data structures, such as entity types, bundles, and
                fields.</p>
            <h4>What is Docker?</h4>
            <p>Docker takes away repetitive, mundane configuration tasks and is used throughout the development
                lifecycle for fast, easy and portable application development – desktop and cloud. Docker’s
                comprehensive end to end platform includes UIs, CLIs, APIs and security that are engineered to work
                together across the entire application delivery lifecycle.</p>
            <h4>What is a CDN?</h4>
            <p>A content delivery network (CDN) refers to a geographically distributed group of servers which work
                together to provide fast delivery of Internet content. At its core, a CDN is a network of servers linked
                together with the goal of delivering content as quickly, cheaply, reliably, and securely as possible. In
                order to improve speed and connectivity, a CDN will place servers at the exchange points between
                different networks.<br><br>A CDN allows for the quick transfer of assets needed for loading Internet
                content including HTML pages, javascript files, stylesheets, images, and videos. The popularity of CDN
                services continues to grow, and today the majority of web traffic is served through CDNs, including
                traffic from major sites like Facebook, Netflix, and Amazon.</p>
            <h4>How do I learn PostgreSQL?</h4>
            <p>PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 30 years of active
                development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.
                This means PostgreSQL offers more complex data types and allows object inheritance, though it also makes
                working with PostgreSQL more complex.
                It is a highly stable database management system, backed by more than 20 years of community development
                which has contributed to its high levels of resilience, integrity, and correctness. PostgreSQL is used
                as the primary data store or data warehouse for many web, mobile, geospatial, and analytics
                applications. PostgreSQL is an easy DBMS solution to start using. You can easily put together a simple
                application with a powerful data store using PostgreSQL within the first or second week of learning.</p>
            <h4>How is MongoDB used?</h4>
            <p>MongoDB is an open source NoSQL database management program.
                MongoDB allows a highly flexible and scalable document structure. NoSQL is used as an alternative to
                traditional relational databases. NoSQL databases are quite useful for working with large sets of
                distributed data. MongoDB is a tool that can manage document-oriented information, store or retrieve
                information. MongoDB’s document model is simple for developers to learn and use, while still providing
                all the capabilities needed to meet the most complex requirements at any scale. We provide drivers for
                10+ languages, and the community has built dozens more.

        <section class="section-title open-source" id="open-source">
            <h2>What does Open Source mean?</h2>

                Open source is a term that originally referred to open source software (OSS). Open source software is code that is designed to be publicly accessible—anyone can see, modify, and distribute the code as they see fit. 
                Open source is a type of licensing agreement that allows users to freely modify a work, use said work in new ways, integrate the work into a larger project or derive a new work based on the original. 
                Open Source Software certainly does have the potential to be more secure than its closed source counterpart. But make no mistake, simply being open source is no guarantee of security. Some popular resources that are available for you are listed below: </p>

                            Technology is our future. One way or another, future developments will change how we view
                            our
                            lives, how we connect with those who mean the most to us, and potentially get connected with
                            new
                            friends. There's no doubt about it, how technology advances will shape our future for the
                            rest
                            of our lives. And I want to be in the center of it all. But where is that exactly?

                            As you once watched movies of holographic keyboards, touchscreen tables, and flying cars, we
                            are
                            seeing today that we not only have some of those things but are only getting closer to
                            making
                            everything we can imagine a reality. Self-driving cars, virtual personal assistants, robotic
                            surgeries, and many more uses of machine learning are helping everyone across the world.

                            And it's thanks to people like Geoff Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, Yann LeCun, and Jurgen
                            Schmidhuber
                            who had faith in neural networks even back in the 1990s and 2000s when their colleagues had
                            left
                            the idea behind. People like that give hope that our dreams, our beliefs, our blueprints can
                            be
                            made into reality. We are only going to advance further, as a society. And, together, we are
                            unstoppable.
